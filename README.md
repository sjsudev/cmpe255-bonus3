### Collect tweets data from twitter via twitter api or Selenium/Beautiful Soup, you can collect data based on your own application/needs.

I used BeautifulSoup, Python, and Twint to scrape data from Twitter 

Here are my dataframe columns:

0 -  emergency_ or not				
1 - created_at
2 - screen_name
3 - tweet_text

### Perform tweets Preprocessing

### Perform tweets classification - Emergency or Not

### To train the classification model, you need to perform data labeling (at least 200 tweets each category)
Try multiple models or multiple configurations (one of them must be neural network based model). Evaluate the accuracy of your solutions, put your result comparison figure/graph in document.
Select the best model, deploy it to the real application and get the realtime tweet classification. You can have one application oriented code (e.g., python server, web app, mobile app) that collects tweets in realtime and return the classification results. Document your efforts to optimize the realtime data mining pipeline and your results/screenshots of your application.
